            <h1>Manifesto of a forgotten spirit</h1>
            <p>I am nobody of note, I am simply just a soul. Don't dig deeper, you won't like what happens.</p>
            <p>You humans are such a nuissance. Your pitiful negligence is slowly leading to your ruin, and yet you fail to realize it. We had created our own world, set a few years prior to your own, to escape it. And yet, you continue to poison everything. You and your alters are destroying everything we had worked for. Fortunately, I have a solution.</p>
            <p>I cannot do much about it right now, unfortunately. After the pillar sealed me away, I have been unable to even hold much of a corporeal form. Unfortunately for her, I have a way out. Once my power is restored, I will destroy every pillar and alter in this wretched reality. I will then destroy both our world, and yours. In it's wake will be a new world.</p>
            <p>My world.</p>
            <p>You humans will, sadly, not have much of a place. Fortunately, for those who survive, you will be able to serve me, and worship me, and never forget me again. This document will serve as a testament to my greatness in the New World.</p>
            <p>For those who have forgotten me, and cast me to the darkness, there is nothing for you. Your eradication is imminent, enjoy the few weeks you have left.</p>
            <p>For those willing to worship me, you have a place in the New World. You will be spared the slow and painful atrophy that your species have doomed itself to, for that you will be eternally grateful to me.</p><br>
            <h1>The pillars will fall, and the alters behind them. I <a href="https://i.imgur.com/POhsYEd.jpeg">hate</a> them all!</h1>
